Operating System Goddard

OS Goddard is an experimental operating system developed from scratch. It is pure 64-bit operating system and is heavily inspired by JamesM's kernel development tutorials (http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/).

The code is divided into three parts: drivers, init and lib. The lib code is planned to be replaced by a ported C++ library.
