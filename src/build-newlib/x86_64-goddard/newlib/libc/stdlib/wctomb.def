@section @code{wctomb}---minimal wide char to multibyte converter
@findex wctomb
@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <stdlib.h>
int wctomb(char *@var{s}, wchar_t @var{wchar});

@end example
@strong{Description}@*
When _MB_CAPABLE is not defined, this is a minimal ANSI-conforming 
implementation of @code{wctomb}.  The
only ``wide characters'' recognized are single bytes,
and they are ``converted'' to themselves.  

When _MB_CAPABLE is defined, this routine calls @code{_wctomb_r} to perform
the conversion, passing a state variable to allow state dependent
decoding.  The result is based on the locale setting which may
be restricted to a defined set of locales.

Each call to @code{wctomb} modifies @code{*@var{s}} unless @var{s} is a null
pointer or _MB_CAPABLE is defined and @var{wchar} is invalid.

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
This implementation of @code{wctomb} returns @code{0} if
@var{s} is @code{NULL}; it returns @code{-1} if _MB_CAPABLE is enabled
and the wchar is not a valid multi-byte character, it returns @code{1}
if _MB_CAPABLE is not defined or the wchar is in reality a single
byte character, otherwise it returns the number of bytes in the
multi-byte character.

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
@code{wctomb} is required in the ANSI C standard.  However, the precise
effects vary with the locale.

@code{wctomb} requires no supporting OS subroutines.
