@strong{Description}@*
The function @code{strtol} converts the string @code{*@var{s}} to
a @code{long}. First, it breaks down the string into three parts:
leading whitespace, which is ignored; a subject string consisting
of characters resembling an integer in the radix specified by @var{base};
and a trailing portion consisting of zero or more unparseable characters,
and always including the terminating null character. Then, it attempts
to convert the subject string into a @code{long} and returns the
result.

If the value of @var{base} is 0, the subject string is expected to look
like a normal C integer constant: an optional sign, a possible `@code{0x}'
indicating a hexadecimal base, and a number. If @var{base} is between
2 and 36, the expected form of the subject is a sequence of letters
and digits representing an integer in the radix specified by @var{base},
with an optional plus or minus sign. The letters @code{a}--@code{z} (or,
equivalently, @code{A}--@code{Z}) are used to signify values from 10 to 35;
only letters whose ascribed values are less than @var{base} are
permitted. If @var{base} is 16, a leading @code{0x} is permitted.

The subject sequence is the longest initial sequence of the input
string that has the expected form, starting with the first
non-whitespace character.  If the string is empty or consists entirely
of whitespace, or if the first non-whitespace character is not a
permissible letter or digit, the subject string is empty.

If the subject string is acceptable, and the value of @var{base} is zero,
@code{strtol} attempts to determine the radix from the input string. A
string with a leading @code{0x} is treated as a hexadecimal value; a string with
a leading 0 and no @code{x} is treated as octal; all other strings are
treated as decimal. If @var{base} is between 2 and 36, it is used as the
conversion radix, as described above. If the subject string begins with
a minus sign, the value is negated. Finally, a pointer to the first
character past the converted subject string is stored in @var{ptr}, if
@var{ptr} is not @code{NULL}.

If the subject string is empty (or not in acceptable form), no conversion
is performed and the value of @var{s} is stored in @var{ptr} (if @var{ptr} is
not @code{NULL}).

The alternate function @code{_strtol_r} is a reentrant version.  The
extra argument @var{reent} is a pointer to a reentrancy structure.

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
@code{strtol} returns the converted value, if any. If no conversion was
made, 0 is returned.

@code{strtol} returns @code{LONG_MAX} or @code{LONG_MIN} if the magnitude of
the converted value is too large, and sets @code{errno} to @code{ERANGE}.

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
@code{strtol} is ANSI.

No supporting OS subroutines are required.
