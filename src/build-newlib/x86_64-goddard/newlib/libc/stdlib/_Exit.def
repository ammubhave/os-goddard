@node _Exit
@section @code{_Exit}---end program execution with no cleanup processing
@findex _Exit
@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <stdlib.h>
void _Exit(int @var{code});

@end example
@strong{Description}@*
Use @code{_Exit} to return control from a program to the host operating
environment.  Use the argument @var{code} to pass an exit status to the
operating environment: two particular values, @code{EXIT_SUCCESS} and
@code{EXIT_FAILURE}, are defined in `@code{stdlib.h}' to indicate success or
failure in a portable fashion.

@code{_Exit} differs from @code{exit} in that it does not run any
application-defined cleanup functions registered with @code{atexit} and
it does not clean up files and streams.  It is identical to @code{_exit}.

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
@code{_Exit} does not return to its caller.

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
@code{_Exit} is defined by the C99 standard.

Supporting OS subroutines required: @code{_exit}.
