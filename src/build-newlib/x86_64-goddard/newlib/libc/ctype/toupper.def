@strong{Description}@*
@code{toupper} is a macro which converts lowercase characters to uppercase,
leaving all other characters unchanged.  It is only defined when
@var{c} is an integer in the range @code{EOF} to @code{255}.

You can use a compiled subroutine instead of the macro definition by
undefining this macro using `@code{#undef toupper}'.

@code{_toupper} performs the same conversion as @code{toupper}, but should
only be used when @var{c} is known to be a lowercase character (@code{a}--@code{z}).

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
@code{toupper} returns the uppercase equivalent of @var{c} when it is a
character between @code{a} and @code{z}, and @var{c} otherwise.

@code{_toupper} returns the uppercase equivalent of @var{c} when it is a
character between @code{a} and @code{z}.  If @var{c} is not one of these
characters, the behaviour of @code{_toupper} is undefined.

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
@code{toupper} is ANSI C.  @code{_toupper} is not recommended for portable programs.

No supporting OS subroutines are required.
