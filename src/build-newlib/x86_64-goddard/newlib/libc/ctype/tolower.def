@strong{Description}@*
@code{tolower} is a macro which converts uppercase characters to lowercase,
leaving all other characters unchanged.  It is only defined when
@var{c} is an integer in the range @code{EOF} to @code{255}.

You can use a compiled subroutine instead of the macro definition by
undefining this macro using `@code{#undef tolower}'.

@code{_tolower} performs the same conversion as @code{tolower}, but should
only be used when @var{c} is known to be an uppercase character (@code{A}--@code{Z}).

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
@code{tolower} returns the lowercase equivalent of @var{c} when it is a
character between @code{A} and @code{Z}, and @var{c} otherwise.

@code{_tolower} returns the lowercase equivalent of @var{c} when it is a
character between @code{A} and @code{Z}.  If @var{c} is not one of these
characters, the behaviour of @code{_tolower} is undefined.

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
@code{tolower} is ANSI C.  @code{_tolower} is not recommended for portable
programs.

No supporting OS subroutines are required.
