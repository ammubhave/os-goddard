@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <stdio.h>
int fgetc(FILE *@var{fp});

#include <stdio.h>
int _fgetc_r(struct _reent *@var{ptr}, FILE *@var{fp});

@end example
@strong{Description}@*
Use @code{fgetc} to get the next single character from the file or stream
identified by @var{fp}.  As a side effect, @code{fgetc} advances the file's
current position indicator.

For a macro version of this function, see @code{getc}.

The function @code{_fgetc_r} is simply a reentrant version of
@code{fgetc} that is passed the additional reentrant structure
pointer argument: @var{ptr}.

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
The next character (read as an @code{unsigned char}, and cast to
@code{int}), unless there is no more data, or the host system reports a
read error; in either of these situations, @code{fgetc} returns @code{EOF}.

You can distinguish the two situations that cause an @code{EOF} result by
using the @code{ferror} and @code{feof} functions.

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
ANSI C requires @code{fgetc}.

Supporting OS subroutines required: @code{close}, @code{fstat}, @code{isatty},
@code{lseek}, @code{read}, @code{sbrk}, @code{write}.
