@strong{Description}@*
@code{putw} is a function, defined in @code{stdio.h}.  You can use @code{putw}
to write a word to the file or stream identified by @var{fp}.  As a side
effect, @code{putw} advances the file's current position indicator.

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
Zero on success, @code{EOF} on failure.

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
@code{putw} is a remnant of K&R C; it is not part of any ISO C Standard.
@code{fwrite} should be used instead.  In fact, this implementation of
@code{putw} is based upon @code{fwrite}.

Supporting OS subroutines required: @code{fwrite}.
