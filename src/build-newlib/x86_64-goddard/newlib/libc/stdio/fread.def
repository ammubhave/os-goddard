@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <stdio.h>
size_t fread(void *restrict @var{buf}, size_t @var{size}, size_t @var{count},
    FILE *restrict @var{fp});

#include <stdio.h>
size_t _fread_r(struct _reent *@var{ptr}, void *restrict @var{buf},
    size_t @var{size}, size_t @var{count}, FILE *restrict @var{fp});

@end example
@strong{Description}@*
@code{fread} attempts to copy, from the file or stream identified by
@var{fp}, @var{count} elements (each of size @var{size}) into memory,
starting at @var{buf}.   @code{fread} may copy fewer elements than
@var{count} if an error, or end of file, intervenes.

@code{fread} also advances the file position indicator (if any) for
@var{fp} by the number of @emph{characters} actually read.

@code{_fread_r} is simply the reentrant version of @code{fread} that
takes an additional reentrant structure pointer argument: @var{ptr}.

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
The result of @code{fread} is the number of elements it succeeded in
reading.

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
ANSI C requires @code{fread}.

Supporting OS subroutines required: @code{close}, @code{fstat}, @code{isatty},
@code{lseek}, @code{read}, @code{sbrk}, @code{write}.
