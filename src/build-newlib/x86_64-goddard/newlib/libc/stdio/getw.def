@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <stdio.h>
int getw(FILE *@var{fp});

@end example
@strong{Description}@*
@code{getw} is a function, defined in @code{stdio.h}.  You can use @code{getw}
to get the next word from the file or stream identified by @var{fp}.  As
a side effect, @code{getw} advances the file's current position
indicator.

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
The next word (read as an @code{int}), unless there is no more
data or the host system reports a read error; in either of these
situations, @code{getw} returns @code{EOF}.  Since @code{EOF} is a valid
@code{int}, you must use @code{ferror} or @code{feof} to distinguish these
situations.

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
@code{getw} is a remnant of K&R C; it is not part of any ISO C Standard.
@code{fread} should be used instead.  In fact, this implementation of
@code{getw} is based upon @code{fread}.

Supporting OS subroutines required: @code{fread}.
