@node getdelim
@section @code{getdelim}---read a line up to a specified line delimiter
@findex getdelim
@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <stdio.h>
int getdelim(char **@var{bufptr}, size_t *@var{n},
    int @var{delim}, FILE *@var{fp});

@end example
@strong{Description}@*
@code{getdelim} reads a file @var{fp} up to and possibly including a specified
delimiter @var{delim}.  The line is read into a buffer pointed to
by @var{bufptr} and designated with size *@var{n}.  If the buffer is
not large enough, it will be dynamically grown by @code{getdelim}.
As the buffer is grown, the pointer to the size @var{n} will be
updated.

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
@code{getdelim} returns @code{-1} if no characters were successfully read;
otherwise, it returns the number of bytes successfully read.
At end of file, the result is nonzero.

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
@code{getdelim} is a glibc extension.

No supporting OS subroutines are directly required.
