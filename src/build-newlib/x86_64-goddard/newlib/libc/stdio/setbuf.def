@section @code{setbuf}---specify full buffering for a file or stream
@findex setbuf
@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <stdio.h>
void setbuf(FILE *@var{fp}, char *@var{buf});

@end example
@strong{Description}@*
@code{setbuf} specifies that output to the file or stream identified by @var{fp}
should be fully buffered.  All output for this file will go to a
buffer (of size @code{BUFSIZ}, specified in `@code{stdio.h}').  Output will
be passed on to the host system only when the buffer is full, or when
an input operation intervenes.

You may, if you wish, supply your own buffer by passing a pointer to
it as the argument @var{buf}.  It must have size @code{BUFSIZ}.  You can
also use @code{NULL} as the value of @var{buf}, to signal that the
@code{setbuf} function is to allocate the buffer.

@*
@strong{Warnings}@*
You may only use @code{setbuf} before performing any file operation other
than opening the file.

If you supply a non-null @var{buf}, you must ensure that the associated
storage continues to be available until you close the stream
identified by @var{fp}.

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
@code{setbuf} does not return a result.

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
Both ANSI C and the System V Interface Definition (Issue 2) require
@code{setbuf}.  However, they differ on the meaning of a @code{NULL} buffer
pointer: the SVID issue 2 specification says that a @code{NULL} buffer
pointer requests unbuffered output.  For maximum portability, avoid
@code{NULL} buffer pointers.

Supporting OS subroutines required: @code{close}, @code{fstat}, @code{isatty},
@code{lseek}, @code{read}, @code{sbrk}, @code{write}.
