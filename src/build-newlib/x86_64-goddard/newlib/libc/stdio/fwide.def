@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <wchar.h>
int fwide(FILE *@var{fp}, int @var{mode})

int _fwide_r(struct _reent *@var{ptr}, FILE *@var{fp}, int @var{mode})

@end example
@strong{Description}@*
When @var{mode} is zero, the @code{fwide} function determines the current
orientation of @var{fp}. It returns a value > 0 if @var{fp} is
wide-character oriented, i.e. if wide character I/O is permitted but
char I/O is disallowed. It returns a value < 0 if @var{fp} is byte
oriented, i.e. if char I/O is permitted but wide character I/O is
disallowed. It returns zero if @var{fp} has no orientation yet; in
this case the next I/O operation might change the orientation (to byte
oriented if it is a char I/O operation, or to wide-character oriented
if it is a wide character I/O operation).

Once a stream has an orientation, it cannot be changed and persists
until the stream is closed, unless the stream is re-opened with freopen,
which removes the orientation of the stream.

When @var{mode} is non-zero, the @code{fwide} function first attempts to set
@var{fp}'s orientation (to wide-character oriented if @var{mode} > 0, or to
byte oriented if @var{mode} < 0). It then returns a value denoting the
current orientation, as above.

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
The @code{fwide} function returns @var{fp}'s orientation, after possibly
changing it. A return value > 0 means wide-character oriented. A return
value < 0 means byte oriented. A return value of zero means undecided.
