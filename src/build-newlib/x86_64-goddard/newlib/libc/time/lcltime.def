#include <time.h>
struct tm *localtime(time_t *@var{clock});
struct tm *localtime_r(time_t *@var{clock}, struct tm *@var{res});

@end example
@strong{Description}@*
@code{localtime} converts the time at @var{clock} into local time, then
converts its representation from the arithmetic representation to the
traditional representation defined by @code{struct tm}.

@code{localtime} constructs the traditional time representation in static
storage; each call to @code{gmtime} or @code{localtime} will overwrite the
information generated by previous calls to either function.

@code{mktime} is the inverse of @code{localtime}.

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
A pointer to the traditional time representation (@code{struct tm}).

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
ANSI C requires @code{localtime}.

@code{localtime} requires no supporting OS subroutines.
