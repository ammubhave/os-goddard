@strong{Description}@*
@code{gmtime} takes the time at @var{clock} representing the number
of elapsed seconds since 00:00:00 on January 1, 1970, Universal
Coordinated Time (UTC, also known in some countries as GMT,
Greenwich Mean time) and converts it to a @code{struct tm}
representation.

@code{gmtime} constructs the traditional time representation in static
storage; each call to @code{gmtime} or @code{localtime} will overwrite the
information generated by previous calls to either function.

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
A pointer to the traditional time representation (@code{struct tm}).

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
ANSI C requires @code{gmtime}.

@code{gmtime} requires no supporting OS subroutines.
