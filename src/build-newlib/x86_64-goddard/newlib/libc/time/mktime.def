@section @code{mktime}---convert time to arithmetic representation
@findex mktime
@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <time.h>
time_t mktime(struct tm *@var{timp});

@end example
@strong{Description}@*
@code{mktime} assumes the time at @var{timp} is a local time, and converts
its representation from the traditional representation defined by
@code{struct tm} into a representation suitable for arithmetic.

@code{localtime} is the inverse of @code{mktime}.

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
If the contents of the structure at @var{timp} do not form a valid
calendar time representation, the result is @code{-1}.  Otherwise, the
result is the time, converted to a @code{time_t} value.

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
ANSI C requires @code{mktime}.

@code{mktime} requires no supporting OS subroutines.
