@section @code{wmemcmp}---compare wide characters in memory

@example
#include <wchar.h>
int wmemcmp(const wchar_t *@var{s1}, const wchar_t *@var{s2}, size_t @var{n});

@end example
@strong{Description}@*
The @code{wmemcmp} function compares the first @var{n} wide characters of the
object pointed to by @var{s1} to the first @var{n} wide characters of the
object pointed to by @var{s2}. This function is not affected by locale
and all wchar_t values are treated identically. The null wide character
and wchar_t values not corresponding to valid characters are not treated
specially.

If @var{n} is zero, @var{s1} and @var{s2} must be a valid pointers and the
function behaves as if the two objects compare equal. 

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
The @code{wmemcmp} function returns an integer greater than, equal to,
or less than zero, accordingly as the object pointed to by @var{s1} is
greater than, equal to, or less than the object pointed to by @var{s2}.

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
@code{wmemcmp} is ISO/IEC 9899/AMD1:1995 (ISO C).

No supporting OS subroutines are required.
