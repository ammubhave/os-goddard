@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <string.h>
char *memmem(const void *@var{s1}, size_t @var{l1}, const void *@var{s2},
    size_t @var{l2});

@end example
@strong{Description}@*

Locates the first occurrence in the memory region pointed to
by @var{s1} with length @var{l1} of the sequence of bytes pointed
to by @var{s2} of length @var{l2}.  If you already know the
lengths of your haystack and needle, @code{memmem} can be much
faster than @code{strstr}.

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
Returns a pointer to the located segment, or a null pointer if
@var{s2} is not found. If @var{l2} is 0, @var{s1} is returned.

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
@code{memmem} is a newlib extension.

@code{memmem} requires no supporting OS subroutines.
