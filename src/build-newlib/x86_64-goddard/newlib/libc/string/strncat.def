#include <string.h>
char *strncat(char *restrict @var{dst}, const char *restrict @var{src},
    size_t @var{length});

@end example
@strong{Description}@*
@code{strncat} appends not more than @var{length} characters from
the string pointed to by @var{src} (including the	terminating
null character) to the end of the string pointed to by
@var{dst}.  The initial character of @var{src} overwrites the null
character at the end of @var{dst}.  A terminating null character
is always appended to the result

@*
@strong{Warnings}@*
Note that a null is always appended, so that if the copy is
limited by the @var{length} argument, the number of characters
appended to @var{dst} is @code{n + 1}.

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
This function returns the initial value of @var{dst}

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
@code{strncat} is ANSI C.

@code{strncat} requires no supporting OS subroutines.
