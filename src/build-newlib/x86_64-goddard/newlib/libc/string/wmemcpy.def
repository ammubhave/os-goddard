@section @code{wmemcpy}---copy wide characters in memory 
@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <wchar.h>
wchar_t *wmemcpy(wchar_t *__restrict @var{d},
    const wchar_t *__restrict @var{s}, size_t @var{n});

@end example
@strong{Description}@*
The @code{wmemcpy} function copies @var{n} wide characters from the object
pointed to by @var{s} to the object pointed to be @var{d}. This function
is not affected by locale and all wchar_t values are treated
identically.  The null wide character and wchar_t values not
corresponding to valid characters are not treated specially.

If @var{n} is zero, @var{d} and @var{s} must be a valid pointers, and the
function copies zero wide characters. 

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
The @code{wmemcpy} function returns the value of @var{d}.

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
@code{wmemcpy} is ISO/IEC 9899/AMD1:1995 (ISO C).

No supporting OS subroutines are required.
