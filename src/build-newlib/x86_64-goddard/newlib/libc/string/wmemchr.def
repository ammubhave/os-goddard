@section @code{wmemchr}---find a wide character in memory
@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <wchar.h>
wchar_t	*wmemchr(const wchar_t *@var{s}, wchar_t @var{c}, size_t @var{n});

@end example
@strong{Description}@*
The @code{wmemchr} function locates the first occurrence of @var{c} in the
initial @var{n} wide characters of the object pointed to be @var{s}. This
function is not affected by locale and all wchar_t values are treated
identically.  The null wide character and wchar_t values not
corresponding to valid characters are not treated specially.

If @var{n} is zero, @var{s} must be a valid pointer and the function
behaves as if no valid occurrence of @var{c} is found. 

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
The @code{wmemchr} function returns a pointer to the located
wide character, or a null pointer if the wide character does not occur
in the object. 

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
@code{wmemchr} is ISO/IEC 9899/AMD1:1995 (ISO C).

No supporting OS subroutines are required.
