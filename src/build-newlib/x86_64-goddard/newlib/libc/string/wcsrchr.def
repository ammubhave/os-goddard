#include <wchar.h>
wchar_t *wcsrchr(const wchar_t *@var{s}, wchar_t @var{c});

@end example
@strong{Description}@*
The @code{wcsrchr} function locates the last occurrence of @var{c} in the
wide-character string pointed to by @var{s}. The value of @var{c} must be a
character representable as a type wchar_t and must be a wide-character
code corresponding to a valid character in the current locale.
The terminating null wide-character code is considered to be part of
the wide-character string. 

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
Upon successful completion, @code{wcsrchr} returns a pointer to the
wide-character code or a null pointer if @var{c} does not occur in the
wide-character string.

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
@code{wcsrchr} is ISO/IEC 9899/AMD1:1995 (ISO C).

No supporting OS subroutines are required.
