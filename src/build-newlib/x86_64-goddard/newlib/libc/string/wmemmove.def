@section @code{wmemmove}---copy wide characters in memory with overlapping areas 
@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <wchar.h>
wchar_t *wmemmove(wchar_t *@var{d}, const wchar_t *@var{s}, size_t @var{n});

@end example
@strong{Description}@*
The @code{wmemmove} function copies @var{n} wide characters from the object
pointed to by @var{s} to the object pointed to by @var{d}. Copying takes
place as if the @var{n} wide characters from the object pointed to by
@var{s} are first copied into a temporary array of @var{n} wide characters
that does not overlap the objects pointed to by @var{d} or @var{s}, and then
the @var{n} wide characters from the temporary array are copied into the
object pointed to by @var{d}.

This function is not affected by locale and all wchar_t values are
treated identically. The null wide character and wchar_t values not
corresponding to valid characters are not treated specially.

If @var{n} is zero, @var{d} and @var{s} must be a valid pointers, and the
function copies zero wide characters. 

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
The @code{wmemmove} function returns the value of @var{d}.

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
@code{wmemmove} is ISO/IEC 9899/AMD1:1995 (ISO C).

No supporting OS subroutines are required.
