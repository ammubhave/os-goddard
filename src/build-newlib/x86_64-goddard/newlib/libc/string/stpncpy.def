@end example
@strong{Description}@*
@code{stpncpy} copies not more than @var{length} characters from the
the string pointed to by @var{src} (including the terminating
null character) to the array pointed to by @var{dst}.  If the
string pointed to by @var{src} is shorter than @var{length}
characters, null characters are appended to the destination
array until a total of @var{length} characters have been
written.

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
This function returns a pointer to the end of the destination string,
thus pointing to the trailing '\0', or, if the destination string is
not null-terminated, pointing to dst + n.

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
@code{stpncpy} is a GNU extension, candidate for inclusion into POSIX/SUSv4.

@code{stpncpy} requires no supporting OS subroutines.
