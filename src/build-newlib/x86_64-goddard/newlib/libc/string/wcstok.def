@example

    const wchar_t *__restrict @var{delimiters},
    wchar_t **__restrict @var{lasts})

@end example
@strong{Description}@*
The @code{wcstok} function is the wide-character equivalent of the
@code{strtok_r} function (which in turn is the same as the @code{strtok}
function with an added argument to make it thread-safe).

The @code{wcstok} function is used to isolate (one at a time)
sequential tokens in a null-terminated wide-character string,
@code{*@var{source}}.  A token is defined as a substring not containing
any wide-characters from @code{*@var{delimiters}}.

The first time that @code{wcstok} is called, @code{*@var{source}} should
be specified with the wide-character string to be searched, and
@code{*@var{lasts}}--but not @code{lasts}, which must be non-NULL--may be
random; subsequent calls, wishing to obtain further tokens from
the same string, should pass a null pointer for @code{*@var{source}}
instead but must supply @code{*@var{lasts}} unchanged from the last
call.  The separator wide-character string, @code{*@var{delimiters}},
must be supplied each time and may change between calls.
A pointer to placeholder @code{*@var{lasts}} must be supplied by
the caller, and is set each time as needed to save the state
by @code{wcstok}.	Every call to @code{wcstok} with @code{*@var{source}}
== @code{NULL} must pass the value of @code{*@var{lasts}} as last set
by @code{wcstok}.

The @code{wcstok} function returns a pointer to the beginning of each 
subsequent token in the string, after replacing the separator 
wide-character itself with a null wide-character.  When no more tokens
remain, a null pointer is returned.

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
@code{wcstok} returns a pointer to the first wide character of a token, or
@code{NULL} if there is no token.

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
@code{wcstok} is C99 and POSIX.1-2001.

@code{wcstok} requires no supporting OS subroutines.
