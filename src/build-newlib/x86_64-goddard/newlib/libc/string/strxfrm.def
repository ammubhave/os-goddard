@strong{Description}@*
This function transforms the string pointed to by @var{s2} and
places the resulting string into the array pointed to by
@var{s1}. The transformation is such that if the @code{strcmp}
function is applied to the two transformed strings, it returns
a value greater than, equal to, or less than zero,
correspoinding to the result of a @code{strcoll} function applied
to the same two original strings.

No more than @var{n} characters are placed into the resulting
array pointed to by @var{s1}, including the terminating null
character. If @var{n} is zero, @var{s1} may be a null pointer. If
copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior
is undefined.

With a C locale, this function just copies.

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
The @code{strxfrm} function returns the length of the transformed string
(not including the terminating null character). If the value returned
is @var{n} or more, the contents of the array pointed to by
@var{s1} are indeterminate.

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
@code{strxfrm} is ANSI C.

@code{strxfrm} requires no supporting OS subroutines.
