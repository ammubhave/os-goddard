@section @code{wcslcpy}---copy a wide-character string to specified length
@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <wchar.h>
size_t wcslcpy(wchar_t *@var{dst}, const wchar_t *@var{src}, size_t @var{siz});

@end example
@strong{Description}@*
@code{wcslcpy} copies wide characters from @var{src} to @var{dst}
such that up to @var{siz} - 1 characters are copied.  A
terminating null is appended to the result, unless @var{siz}
is zero.

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
@code{wcslcpy} returns the number of wide characters in @var{src},
not including the terminating null wide character.  If the
return value is greater than or equal to @var{siz}, then
not all wide characters were copied from @var{src} and truncation
occurred.

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
No supporting OS subroutines are required.
