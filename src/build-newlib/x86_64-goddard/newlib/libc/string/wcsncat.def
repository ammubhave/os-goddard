@node wcsncat
@section @code{wcsncat}---concatenate part of two wide-character strings 
@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <wchar.h>
wchar_t *wcsncat(wchar_t *__restrict @var{s1},
    const wchar_t *__restrict @var{s2}, size_t @var{n});

@end example
@strong{Description}@*
The @code{wcsncat} function appends not more than @var{n} wide-character
codes (a null wide-character code and wide-character codes that follow
it are not appended) from the array pointed to by @var{s2} to the end of
the wide-character string pointed to by @var{s1}. The initial
wide-character code of @var{s2} overwrites the null wide-character code
at the end of @var{s1}.
A terminating null wide-character code is always appended to the result.
If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behaviour is
undefined.

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
The @code{wcsncat} function returns @var{s1}; no return value is reserved to
indicate an error.

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
@code{wcsncat} is ISO/IEC 9899/AMD1:1995 (ISO C).

No supporting OS subroutines are required.
