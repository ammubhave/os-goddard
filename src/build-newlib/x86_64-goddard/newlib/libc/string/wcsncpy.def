@section @code{wcsncpy}---copy part of a wide-character string 
@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <wchar.h>
wchar_t *wcsncpy(wchar_t *__restrict @var{s1},
    const wchar_t *__restrict @var{s2}, size_t @var{n});

@end example
@strong{Description}@*
The @code{wcsncpy} function copies not more than @var{n} wide-character codes
(wide-character codes that follow a null wide-character code are not
copied) from the array pointed to by @var{s2} to the array pointed to
by @var{s1}. If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the
behaviour is undefined.  Note that if @var{s1} contains more than @var{n}
wide characters before its terminating null, the result is not
null-terminated.

If the array pointed to by @var{s2} is a wide-character string that is
shorter than @var{n} wide-character codes, null wide-character codes are
appended to the copy in the array pointed to by @var{s1}, until @var{n}
wide-character codes in all are written. 

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
The @code{wcsncpy} function returns @var{s1}; no return value is reserved to
indicate an error. 

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
ISO/IEC 9899; POSIX.1.

No supporting OS subroutines are required.
