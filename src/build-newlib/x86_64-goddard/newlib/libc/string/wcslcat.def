@section @code{wcslcat}---concatenate wide-character strings to specified length
@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <wchar.h>
size_t wcslcat(wchar_t *@var{dst}, const wchar_t *@var{src}, size_t @var{siz});

@end example
@strong{Description}@*
The @code{wcslcat} function appends wide characters from @var{src} to
end of the @var{dst} wide-character string so that the resultant
wide-character string is not more than @var{siz} wide characters
including the terminating null wide-character code.  A terminating
null wide character is always added unless @var{siz} is 0.  Thus,
the maximum number of wide characters that can be appended from
@var{src} is @var{siz} - 1. If copying takes place between objects 
that overlap, the behaviour is undefined.

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
Wide-character string length of initial @var{dst} plus the
wide-character string length of @var{src} (does not include
terminating null wide-characters).  If the return value is
greater than or equal to @var{siz}, then truncation occurred and
not all wide characters from @var{src} were appended.

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
No supporting OS subroutines are required.
