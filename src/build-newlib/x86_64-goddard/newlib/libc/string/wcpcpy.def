@section @code{wcpcpy}---copy a wide-character string returning a pointer to its end
@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <wchar.h>
wchar_t *wcpcpy(wchar_t *@var{s1}, const wchar_t *,@var{s2});

@end example
@strong{Description}@*
The @code{wcpcpy} function copies the wide-character string pointed to by
@var{s2} (including the terminating null wide-character code) into the
array pointed to by @var{s1}. If copying takes place between objects that
overlap, the behaviour is undefined. 

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
This function returns a pointer to the end of the destination string,
thus pointing to the trailing '\0'.

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
@code{wcpcpy} is a GNU extension.

No supporting OS subroutines are required.
