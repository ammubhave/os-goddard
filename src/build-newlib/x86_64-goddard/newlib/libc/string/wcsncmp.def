@section @code{wcsncmp}---compare part of two wide-character strings 
@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <wchar.h>
int wcsncmp(const wchar_t *@var{s1}, const wchar_t *@var{s2}, size_t @var{n});

@end example
@strong{Description}@*
The @code{wcsncmp} function compares not more than @var{n} wide-character
codes (wide-character codes that follow a null wide-character code are
not compared) from the array pointed to by @var{s1} to the array pointed
to by @var{s2}.

The sign of a non-zero return value is determined by the sign of the
difference between the values of the first pair of wide-character codes
that differ in the objects being compared. 

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
Upon successful completion, @code{wcsncmp} returns an integer greater than,
equal to or less than 0, if the possibly null-terminated array pointed
to by @var{s1} is greater than, equal to or less than the possibly
null-terminated array pointed to by @var{s2} respectively. 

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
@code{wcsncmp} is ISO/IEC 9899/AMD1:1995 (ISO C).

No supporting OS subroutines are required.
