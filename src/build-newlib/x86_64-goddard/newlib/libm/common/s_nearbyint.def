@end example
@strong{Description}@*
The @code{nearbyint} functions round their argument to an integer value in
floating-point format, using the current rounding direction and
(supposedly) without raising the "inexact" floating-point exception.
See the @code{rint} functions for the same function with the "inexact"
floating-point exception being raised when appropriate.

@*
@strong{Bugs}@*
Newlib does not support the floating-point exception model, so that
the floating-point exception control is not present and thereby what may
be seen will be compiler and hardware dependent in this regard.
The Newlib @code{nearbyint} functions are identical to the @code{rint}
functions with respect to the floating-point exception behavior, and
will cause the "inexact" exception to be raised for most targets.

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
@var{x} rounded to an integral value, using the current rounding direction.

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
ANSI C, POSIX
