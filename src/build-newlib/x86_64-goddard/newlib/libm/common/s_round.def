@strong{Description}@*
The @code{round} functions round their argument to the nearest integer
value in floating-point format, rounding halfway cases away from zero,
regardless of the current rounding direction.  (While the "inexact"
floating-point exception behavior is unspecified by the C standard, the
@code{round} functions are written so that "inexact" is not raised if the
result does not equal the argument, which behavior is as recommended by
IEEE 754 for its related functions.)

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
@var{x} rounded to an integral value.

@strong{Portability}@*
