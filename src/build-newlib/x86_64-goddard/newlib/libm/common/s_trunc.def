@strong{Description}@*
The @code{trunc} functions round their argument to the integer value, in
floating format, nearest to but no larger in magnitude than the
argument, regardless of the current rounding direction.  (While the
"inexact" floating-point exception behavior is unspecified by the C
standard, the @code{trunc} functions are written so that "inexact" is not
raised if the result does not equal the argument, which behavior is as
recommended by IEEE 754 for its related functions.)

@strong{Returns}@*
@var{x} truncated to an integral value.
