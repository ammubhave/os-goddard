@section @code{expm1}, @code{expm1f}---exponential minus 1

@findex expm1f
@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <math.h>
double expm1(double @var{x});
float expm1f(float @var{x});

@end example
@strong{Description}@*
@code{expm1} and @code{expm1f} calculate the exponential of @var{x}
and subtract 1, that is,
@ifnottex
e raised to the power @var{x} minus 1 (where e
@end ifnottex
@tex
$e^x - 1$ (where $e$
@end tex
is the base of the natural system of logarithms, approximately
2.71828).  The result is accurate even for small values of
@var{x}, where using @code{exp(@var{x})-1} would lose many
significant digits.

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
e raised to the power @var{x}, minus 1.

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
Neither @code{expm1} nor @code{expm1f} is required by ANSI C or by
the System V Interface Definition (Issue 2).
