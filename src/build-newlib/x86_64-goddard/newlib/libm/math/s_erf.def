@strong{Synopsis}
@example

double erf(double @var{x});
float erff(float @var{x});
double erfc(double @var{x});
float erfcf(float @var{x});
@end example
@strong{Description}@*
@code{erf} calculates an approximation to the ``error function'',
which estimates the probability that an observation will fall within
@var{x} standard deviations of the mean (assuming a normal
distribution).
@tex
The error function is defined as
$${2\over\sqrt\pi}\times\int_0^x e^{-t^2}dt$$
@end tex

@code{erfc} calculates the complementary probability; that is,
@code{erfc(@var{x})} is @code{1 - erf(@var{x})}.  @code{erfc} is computed directly,
so that you can use it to avoid the loss of precision that would
result from subtracting large probabilities (on large @var{x}) from 1.

@code{erff} and @code{erfcf} differ from @code{erf} and @code{erfc} only in the
argument and result types.

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
For positive arguments, @code{erf} and all its variants return a
probability---a number between 0 and 1.

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
None of the variants of @code{erf} are ANSI C.
