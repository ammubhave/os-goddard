@section @code{cacosh}, @code{cacoshf}---complex arc hyperbolic cosine
@findex cacosh
@findex cacoshf
@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <complex.h>
double complex cacosh(double complex @var{z});
float complex cacoshf(float complex @var{z});

@end example
@strong{Description}@*
These functions compute the complex arc hyperbolic cosine of @var{z},
with a branch cut at values less than 1 along the real axis.

@code{cacoshf} is identical to @code{cacosh}, except that it performs
its calculations on @code{floats complex}.

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
@ifnottex
These functions return the complex arc hyperbolic cosine value, 
in the range of a half-strip of non-negative values along the 
real axis and in the interval [-i * pi, +i * pi] along the 
imaginary axis.
@end ifnottex
@tex
These functions return the complex arc hyperbolic cosine value, 
in the range of a half-strip of non-negative values along the 
real axis and in the interval [$-i\pi$, $+i\pi$] along the 
imaginary axis.

@strong{Portability}@*
@code{cacosh} and @code{cacoshf} are ISO C99
