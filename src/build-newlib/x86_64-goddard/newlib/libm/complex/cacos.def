@section @code{cacos}, @code{cacosf}---complex arc cosine
@findex cacos
@findex cacosf
@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <complex.h>
double complex cacos(double complex @var{z});
float complex cacosf(float complex @var{z});

@end example
@strong{Description}@*
These functions compute the complex arc cosine of @var{z},
with branch cuts outside the interval [-1, +1] along the real axis.

@code{cacosf} is identical to @code{cacos}, except that it performs
its calculations on @code{floats complex}.

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
@ifnottex
These functions return the complex arc cosine value, in the range
of a strip mathematically  unbounded  along the imaginary axis
and in the interval [0, pi] along the real axis.
@end ifnottex
@tex
These functions return the complex arc cosine value, in the range
of a strip mathematically  unbounded  along the imaginary axis
and in the interval [@code{0}, $\pi$] along the real axis.

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
@code{cacos} and @code{cacosf} are ISO C99
