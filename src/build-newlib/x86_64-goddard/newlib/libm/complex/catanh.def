@section @code{catanh}, @code{catanhf}---complex arc hyperbolic tangent
@findex catanh
@findex catanhf
@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <complex.h>
double complex catanh(double complex @var{z});
float complex catanhf(float complex @var{z});

@end example
@strong{Description}@*
These functions compute the complex arc hyperbolic tan of @var{z},
with branch cuts outside the interval [-1, +1] along the
real axis.

@code{catanhf} is identical to @code{catanh}, except that it performs
its calculations on @code{floats complex}.

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
@ifnottex
These functions return the complex arc hyperbolic tangent value,
in the range of a strip mathematically unbounded along the
real axis and in the interval [-i*p/2, +i*p/2] along the
imaginary axis.
@end ifnottex
@tex
These functions return the complex arc hyperbolic tangent value,
in the range of a strip mathematically unbounded along the
real axis and in the interval [$-i\pi/2$, $+i\pi/2$] along the
imaginary axis.
@end tex

@*
@strong{Portability}@*
@code{catanh} and @code{catanhf} are ISO C99
