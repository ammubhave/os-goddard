@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <complex.h>
double complex casinh(double complex @var{z});
float complex casinhf(float complex @var{z});

@end example
@strong{Description}@*
@ifnottex
These functions compute the complex arc hyperbolic sine of @var{z},
with branch cuts outside the interval [-i, +i] along the 
imaginary axis.        
@end ifnottex
@tex
These functions compute the complex arc hyperbolic sine of @var{z},
with branch cuts outside the interval [$-i$, $+i$] along the 
imaginary axis.        
@end tex

@code{casinhf} is identical to @code{casinh}, except that it performs
its calculations on @code{floats complex}.

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
@ifnottex
These functions return the complex arc hyperbolic sine value, 
in the range of a strip mathematically unbounded along the 
real axis and in the interval [-i*p/2, +i*p/2] along the 
imaginary axis.
@end ifnottex
@tex
These functions return the complex arc hyperbolic sine value, 
in the range of a strip mathematically unbounded along the 
real axis and in the interval [$-i\pi/2$, $+i\pi/2$] along the 
imaginary axis.

@strong{Portability}@*
@code{casinh} and @code{casinhf} are ISO C99
