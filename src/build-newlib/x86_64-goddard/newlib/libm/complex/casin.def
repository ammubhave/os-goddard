@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <complex.h>
double complex casin(double complex @var{z});
float complex casinf(float complex @var{z});

@end example
@strong{Description}@*
These functions compute the complex arc sine of @var{z},
with branch cuts outside the interval [-1, +1] along the real axis.

@code{casinf} is identical to @code{casin}, except that it performs
its calculations on @code{floats complex}.

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
@ifnottex
These functions return the complex arc sine value, in the range
of a strip mathematically  unbounded  along the imaginary axis
and in the interval [-pi/2, +pi/2] along the real axis.
@end ifnottex
@tex
These functions return the complex arc sine value, in the range
of a strip mathematically  unbounded  along the imaginary axis
and in the interval [$-\pi/2$, $+\pi/2$] along the real axis.
@end tex

@strong{Portability}@*
@code{casin} and @code{casinf} are ISO C99
