@section @code{clog}, @code{clogf}---complex base-e logarithm
@findex clog
@findex clogf
@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <complex.h>
double complex clog(double complex @var{z});
float complex clogf(float complex @var{z});

@end example
@strong{Description}@*
These functions compute the complex natural (base-@var{e}) logarithm 
of @var{z}, with a branch cut along the negative real axis. 

@code{clogf} is identical to @code{clog}, except that it performs
its calculations on @code{floats complex}.

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
@ifnottex
The clog functions return the complex natural logarithm value, in 
the range of a strip mathematically unbounded along the real axis 
and in the interval [-i*pi , +i*pi] along the imaginary axis.
@end ifnottex
@tex
The clog functions return the complex natural logarithm value, in
the range of a strip mathematically unbounded along the real axis
and in the interval [$-i\pi$, $+i\pi$] along the imaginary axis.

@strong{Portability}@*
