@section @code{catan}, @code{catanf}---complex arc tangent
@findex catan
@findex catanf
@strong{Synopsis}
@example
#include <complex.h>
double complex catan(double complex @var{z});
float complex catanf(float complex @var{z});

@end example
@strong{Description}@*
@ifnottex
These functions compute the complex arc tangent of @var{z},
with branch cuts outside the interval [-i, +i] along the 
imaginary axis.
@end ifnottex
@tex
These functions compute the complex arc tangent of @var{z},
with branch cuts outside the interval [$-i$, $+i$] along the 
imaginary axis.
@end tex

@code{catanf} is identical to @code{catan}, except that it performs
its calculations on @code{floats complex}.

@*
@strong{Returns}@*
@ifnottex
These functions return the complex arc tangent value, in the range
of a strip mathematically  unbounded  along the imaginary axis
and in the interval [-pi/2, +pi/2] along the real axis.
@end ifnottex
@tex
These functions return the complex arc tangent, in the range
of a strip mathematically  unbounded  along the imaginary axis
and in the interval [$-\pi/2$, $+\pi/2$] along the real axis.
@end tex
